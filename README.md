# Flight Fare Prediction

This project here is designed to obtain data from an Indian domestic flight's dataset and use those attributes to predict the prices of future flights.

Extensive EDA has been performed, along with the use of Random Forest Regression and Grid Search CV/ Randomized Search CV to obtain the best hyperparameters and
hence the best results.

## Implementing: 

Run the flight_price.ipynb file. No additional headerfiles/libraries have been downloaded, standard jupyter notebook/ colab with its included packages are more than enough.

## Downloading complete directory with trained model weights:
